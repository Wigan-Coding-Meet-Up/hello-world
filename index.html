  <h2>Can you tell what type of "h" element I am? </h2>
  <p class="p-two">Hello, I am a "Paragraph" element. Can you see how I am displayed? Remember there are a few different
    display
    properties. We have spoken about "In-Line" and "Block" level display. Do you know what this "p" elements display
    level is? You guessed it! It's 'Block" level!</p>

  <h2>Let's have a look at some "In-Line" display elements.</h2>
  <p class="p-one">These are image elements and are displayed "In-Line"</p>

  <img class="number1" src="../hello-world/Images/number1.jpg" alt="Number 1 image">
  <img class="number1" src="../hello-world/Images/number2.png" alt="Number 2 image">
  <img class="number1" src="../hello-world/Images/number3.png" alt="Number 3 image">
  <p class="p-one">We will discuss more about "In-Line" and :Block" level elements when we finally start CSS3</p>
