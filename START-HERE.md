# Welcome to HTML5 hello-world.  :computer:

In this section we will learn about the different types of HTML tags/elements, why we would use them and when?

There are many different types of tags/elements in HTML5 and they are one and the same.

Tags/elements in HTML are the building blocks of any website or application.

### HTML stands for   :arrow_down:
```
Hyper Text Markup Language
```

You can read and research the history of HTML and it's previous versions here:

:x: [A breif history of html](https://www.wired.com/1997/04/a-brief-history-of-html/)

If we think of HTML5 being the skeleton of our website then we would not be far away with our presumption.
All HTML5 pages are called <b>"Documents"</b> and are the building blocks for any website or application.

### Here are some more commonly used HTML5 Elements.   :heavy_exclamation_mark:

#### Remember!
Some elements in HTML are styled differently. This means some of them display "In-Line" and some of them display as "Block". We will get to what both these display styles mean when we start <b>CSS3</b>.

## The &#60;head&#62; element   :arrow_down:
The &#60;head&#62; element is used to define the <b>meta data</b> in our HTML document. It looks like this:

&#60;head&#62; &#60;/head&#62;

This element goes above the &#60;body&#62; element and contains language information and font type information. This allows our browser to read and display content accordingly.

### Typical use case

```
<head>

<title>Welcome to Wigan Code Meet-Up </title>

 </head>
 
 ```

* More information on <b>meta data</b> can be found here:

## The &#60;title&#62; element   :arrow_down:
The &#60;title&#62; element is used to define the <b>Title</b> in our HTML document. It looks like this:

&#60;title&#62; &#60;/title&#62;

This element goes inside the &#60;head&#62; element and contains the title of our webpage/website. This allows our browser to read and display content accordingly.

### Typical use case

```
<head>

<title>Welcome to Wigan Code Meet-Up </title>

 </head>
 
 ```

 This will display the title of the Website in the browsers tab!

Notice how we have an opening &#60;body&#62; and a closing &#60;/body&#62; tags. Most elements in HTML require opening and closing tag. The difference if you look closely, is a /.
There are elements that don't require a closing tag, we will get to those later!

The <b>Header</b> elementopen he   is a very descriptive tag. There are 6 header tags in total. They range from &#60;h1&#62; to a &#60;h6&#62;. The size of the text get's smaller the higher the h number goes. So a &#60;h1&#62; tag is the largest font-size and the &#60;h6&#62; tag has the smallest font-size.
